# Predictive analysis of weather conditions in Biak Numfor

This project aims to analyze weather patterns and changes in Biak Numfor Regency during the period from January 2010 to August 2023, as well as to develop a prediction model based on historical data. The weather variables analyzed include:
- Minimum temperature
- Maximum temperature
- Average humidity
- Rainfall
- Maximum wind speed
- Wind direction at maximum speed

The analysis was conducted starting from data cleaning, trend and correlation analysis, to the development of a prediction model using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The model was not used to predict actual future data, but was tested using historical data to measure its performance.

## Background


## Objectives
This project aims to:
1. Analyzing weather patterns in Biak Numfor from 2010 to 2023.
2. Performing trend and correlation analyses to understand the relationships between weather variables.
3. Building a prediction model using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method.
4. Testing the model's performance using historical data that the model has not seen before.
5. Evaluating the accuracy level using MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, and coefficient of variation metrics.
6. Providing insight into the potential of this model for use in long-term weather prediction.
